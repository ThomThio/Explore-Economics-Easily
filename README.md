# Explore-Economics-Easily
Final Project for Data Visualization module at Singapore Management University


The project uses:
1. Python
2. Lots of JS
3. Lots of Data Files

It uses Heroku to host, so pay more attention to the StaticFile and Environment (Python) it needs to run in.

Live version can be accessed at http://eaeapp.herokuapp.com/
Note: Not all data sets are available or completely clean!
